# PDP Bootcamp Problemset 00

This repo holds the 'first' problem set for the Programming Design Paradigms course I took in the fall of 2014. 

This problem set was labelled 00, as it was expected to be completed prior to the first week of class, before the 'real' problem sets were diseminated. 

It's just some simple problems tackled in Racket, so I figured there was no harm in leaving it up.
